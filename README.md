serverless raffle project

----------------------------------------------

Just finished building a Serverless Raffle Project!

This lab was all about combining AWS Lambda + DynamoDB to create a fully serverless raffle system 🎲

Here’s what I did:
1️⃣ Created a DynamoDB table to store all participants.
2️⃣ Built a Lambda function with an IAM Role (full DynamoDB access + CloudWatch logging).
3️⃣ The function can:

Take new participants and store them in DynamoDB 🗃️

Get the total number of entries 🔢

Randomly choose 3 lucky winners 🎉

It’s amazing how powerful and clean the Serverless architecture feels — no servers, just pure logic in the cloud ☁️💪
